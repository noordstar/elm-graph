# Elm graphs

Most existing implementations (such as
[Janiczek/elm-graph](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Janiczek/elm-graph/latest/) and
[drathier/elm-graph](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/drathier/elm-graph/latest/))
offer limited capabilities for defining nodes and edges.

This library aims to be a simple but efficient method to represent, build and
explore a graph-based data type.

## How to install

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
elm install noordstar/elm-graph
```
